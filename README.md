In October 2017 we reported on figures showing <a href="http://birminghameastside.com/2017/10/16/domestic-violence-funding-cuts-birmingham/"> domestic violence “high-risk” cases in Birmingham had nearly doubled in the last 4 years, but the spending on domestic violence services by Birmingham City Council (BCC) hadn’t seen the same increase </a>. 

This was part of a national level investgation carried by <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-10-16/a-system-at-breaking-point">The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ)</a>. They found out that local authorities across England have cut their spending on domestic violence refuges by nearly a quarter (24%) since 2010, according to our new research.

# Get the data
The data was obtained as part of a nationwide investigation by TBIJ. They made freedom of Information requests to local authorities across England asing for information about the amount they spend on women’s refuges since 2010. 

The data used for this specific report came from a FOI request answered by the Birmingham City Council. The file below show the information used by the Birmingham Eastside team to create the visualisation.
